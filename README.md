# python-project
to oragnize and manage files

here in this project you can oragnize and manage files path.
for example in a directory assume that there are multiple files like pictures,pdf,ppt,movies,music etc
so if we want to find any file it will be time consuming 
so we made a solution of it in our project.

in this project when users run the programme user should enter the source path means which folder path user need to manage and destination path where user should move the files 
and arrange.
at the end in the destination path it will create a mainfolder and inside the main folder it will create folders consisting of files.
it will create folders based on extensions like if extension is of jpg then it will create folder of jpg likewise..

here we import os for using os commands
and imported shutil for moving files to one directory to another
